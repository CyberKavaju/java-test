Java Basics,Arrays and Exception Handling,What will be the output of following program code? ```java import java.io.*; public class Whizlabs{ public static void main(String args[]){ int[] array = new int[10]; System.out.println("Accessing Element Eleven: " + array[10]); } }```,Compilation Fails.,Oops. Identified Exception : java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 10,Accessing Element Eleven: 0,Oops. Identified Exception java.lang.NoDataFoundException.,,B,Array is declared with 10 elements. Then the code tries to access the 11th index element of the array which throws a standard exception java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
Java Basics,Exception Handling,Choose the correct options to complete the following program code. (Select 2 options.) ```java 1. public void method() _____ Exception { 2. _____ Exception(); }```,Fill throws in line 1,Fill throws new in Line 1,Fill throw new in line 2,Fill throws in line 2,Fill throws new in line 2,A,In method declaration the keyword throws is used. So here at line 1 we have to use option A. To actually throw an exception the keyword throw is used and a new exception is created so at line 2 we have to use throw and new keywords which is option C.
Java Basics,Data Types,Which of the following statements about Java primitive data types is correct?,All primitive types are objects,int can store values up to 2^32,float requires the 'f' suffix for literals,Strings are primitive types,,C,In Java float literals require the 'f' suffix to distinguish them from double literals. For example float x = 3.14f; Without the suffix the compiler treats it as a double which cannot be implicitly converted to float.
