Java Basics,Exception Handling,What will be the output of following program? ```java public class Test { public static void main(String[] args) { int[] arr = new int[5]; System.out.println(arr[10]); } }```,Program runs successfully,ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException,NullPointerException,Compilation error,,B,The program will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The array is declared with 5 elements (indices 0-4) but the code tries to access index 10 which is out of bounds. This results in a java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException at runtime.
OOP Concepts,Inheritance,Choose the correct statements about Java inheritance. (Select 2 options.) Which of the following are true?,Java supports multiple inheritance,A subclass inherits all methods from superclass,private members are inherited,final classes can be extended,super keyword calls parent constructor,B,In Java a subclass inherits all non-private members from its superclass. The super keyword is used to call the parent constructor or access parent class members. Java does not support multiple inheritance of classes only interfaces.
Data Types,Primitives,Which primitive data type statement is correct?,boolean can store true false or null,char uses 8 bits in Java,float literals need f suffix,int maximum value is 2^31,,C,Float literals in Java require the f or F suffix to distinguish them from double literals. For example float x = 3.14f; Without the suffix the compiler treats the literal as double which cannot be implicitly converted to float causing a compilation error.
