# Main characteristics of JAVA

---

- What makes difference from java and other programming languages is the fact that you just need to write the code once and it has a virtual environment that runs it on any machine.
- The language is compiled but at the same time it's interpreted on the virtual machine.

## You need to have one main() method in your program

Java will look for the `main()` method to initiate the program. it will not compile it you don't have a man method and you should have only one main() method in your program, you call the class what ever you want, but you have to call the file name the same as your class. 

file name: `MyClass.java`

```java

public class MyClass{ //same as the file name

	public static void main(String[] args){//my program starts here
		
		System.out.println("Hello World!");
	
	}

}

```
