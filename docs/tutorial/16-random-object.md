# Random Object

this is a very useful tool from java for many type of uses and its simple to use

first we need to import it like so;

```java
import java.util.Random
```

and we can use it like this;

```java
Random random = new Random();

//get a random number from 1 to 10
luckyNumber = random.nextInt(1, 11)
```

the firt is includ the second is excluded so if you want one the random results to be `10` you must put the second argument `11`
