# Simple execution of the java program without and IDE

---

to compile the the code you just have to save the file with the class name and the extension `.java` go navigate to the folder where you saved the file and compile this code:

```bash

javac ClassName.java

```

once it compiles and doesn't throw any errors it will create a file with the extension `.class` this one you can execute with the following command;

```bash

java ClassName

```

Make sure not to ad the extension `.class` only the class name and this will execute the program
