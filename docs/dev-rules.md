# Rules for Developing Agentic AI

## TDD Rules for Agentic AI Development

1. **Define Clear Objectives**: Ensure each test corresponds to a specific, measurable goal for the AI agent's behavior or functionality.
2. **Start with Simple Tests**: Begin with basic functionality tests before moving to complex scenarios.
3. **Behavior-Driven Testing**: Write tests that validate the agent's decision-making and adaptability in dynamic environments.
4. **Mock External Dependencies**: Use mocks or stubs for APIs, databases, or other external systems to isolate the agent's logic.
5. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously refine tests as the agent's capabilities evolve.
6. **Edge Case Coverage**: Include tests for edge cases and unexpected inputs to ensure robustness.
7. **Performance Metrics**: Incorporate tests to measure the agent's efficiency and response times.
8. **Explainability Validation**: Test the agent's ability to provide clear explanations for its decisions.
9. **Fail Fast Philosophy**: Design tests to quickly identify issues, enabling rapid debugging.
10. **Automated Regression Testing**: Ensure all tests are automated and run frequently to catch regressions early.

## Development flow rules

1. **Plan Before Coding**: Outline the architecture and design of the AI agent before writing any code.
2. **Use Version Control**: Maintain a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate effectively.
3. **Modular Design**: Break down the agent's functionality into small, manageable modules or components.
4. **Documentation**: Document the code and architecture to ensure clarity for future developers.
5. **Code Reviews**: Conduct regular code reviews to maintain code quality and share knowledge among team members.
6. **Testing Framework**: Use a robust testing framework.
