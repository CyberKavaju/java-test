"Working with Selected classes from the Java API","StringBuilder Class","What is the output of the following code?\n\n```java\nStringBuilder s1 = new StringBuilder(""Java"");\nString s2 = ""Love"";\ns1.append(s2);\ns1.substring(4);\nint foundAt = s1.indexOf(s2);\nSystem.out.println(foundAt);\n```","-1","3","4","StringIndexOutOfBoundsException","Compilation error","C","The append() method adds ""Love"" to ""Java"", making it ""JavaLove"". The substring(4) call returns ""Love"" but does not modify s1. The indexOf(""Love"") finds it starting at index 4."
"Working with Methods and Encapsulation","Access Modifiers","Which access modifier makes a member available only to classes within the same package or subclasses?","private","protected","public","package-private",,"B","The protected access modifier allows access within the same package and to subclasses even in other packages. The private modifier is only within the same class, and package-private doesn't permit subclass access from other packages."
"Using Operators and Decision Constructs","Switch Statement","Which initialization for cardVal will cause the following code to print ""Stand""?\n\n```java\nswitch (cardVal) {\n    case 4: case 5: case 6:\n    case 7: case 8:\n        System.out.println(""Hit"");\n        break;\n    case 9: case 10: case 11:\n        System.out.println(""Double"");\n        break;\n    case 15: case 16:\n        System.out.println(""Surrender"");\n        break;\n    default:\n        System.out.println(""Stand"");\n}\n```","int cardVal = 6;","int cardVal = 10;","int cardVal = 15;","int cardVal = 18;",,"D","The default case is executed for any value of cardVal that is not explicitly handled by one of the case statements. The values 6, 10, and 15 are handled by specific cases. Only 18 is not handled, causing ""Stand"" to be printed."
