# Question Generation Rules for Java Test Application

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive rules and guidelines for creating questions for the Java SE 8 Programmer I (1Z0-808) Mock Test Application. Follow these rules to ensure consistency, quality, and proper formatting of questions in the system.

## üìã CSV Template Structure

All questions must follow the exact CSV template format:
```csv
domain,topic,question_text,option_a,option_b,option_c,option_d,option_e,correct_answer,explanation
```

## üîß Required Fields

### Mandatory Fields (Must be filled)

## ‚úçÔ∏è Question Text Guidelines

### Code-Based Questions
- Always use proper Java syntax and formatting
- Include complete, compilable code snippets when possible
- Use realistic variable names and scenarios
- For incomplete code, clearly indicate what's missing

### Code Block Formatting
The system automatically formats code blocks. You can write code in several ways:

**Method 1: Inline with question (for short code)**
```
What is the output of the following code? ```java int i = 258; byte b = (byte) i; System.out.println(b); ```
```

**Method 2: Using code blocks (recommended for longer code)**
```
What happens when compiling and running the following code? 

```java
import java.util.Date;
import java.sql.Date;
class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Date d = new Date();
    }
}
```
```

**Method 3: Numbered lines for reference (when line numbers matter)**
```java
What is the problem with this code?
1. public class Test {
2.     public static void main(String[] args) {
3.         int sum = 0;
4.         for(int x = 0; x < 10; x++)
5.             sum += x;
6.         System.out.println("sum = " + x);
7.     }
8. }
```

### When to Use Each Method:
- **Method 1**: Simple expressions, single statements, short snippets (1-2 lines)
- **Method 2**: Complete classes, multiple statements, complex logic (3+ lines)
- **Method 3**: When referencing specific line numbers in explanations or when line positioning is important

### Multi-Part Questions
- Use clear separators between question parts
- Each part should be answerable independently
- **Note: System only supports single-choice selection** - users can only select one answer (A, B, C, D, or E)

## üìã Answer Options Guidelines

### Option Content
- Keep options concise but descriptive
- Use consistent formatting across options
- For code output questions, show exact output including quotes and formatting
- Use "Compilation error" for compile-time issues
- Use "Runtime exception" for runtime issues

### Option Ordering
- Order logically when possible (numerical, alphabetical, or by likelihood)
- Place "Compilation error" and "Runtime exception" typically as later options
- Don't make correct answers obviously different in length or style

### Examples of Good Options:
```csv
option_a,true true
option_b,true false  
option_c,false true
option_d,false false
option_e,Compilation error
```

## ‚úÖ Correct Answer Guidelines

### Single-Choice System
- **The system supports only single-choice questions** - users can select exactly one answer
- Each question must have exactly one correct answer (A, B, C, D, or E)
- Multiple correct answers are not supported by the system

### Format
- Must be exactly one letter: A, B, C, D, or E (uppercase)
- Must correspond to an existing option
- Cannot be empty

### Validation
- The system validates that correct_answer matches available options
- If you only have 3 options (A, B, C), correct_answer must be A, B, or C

## üìñ Explanation Guidelines

### Content Requirements
- Explain WHY the correct answer is right
- Explain WHY incorrect options are wrong (when relevant)
- Use technical terminology appropriately
- Reference Java language specifications when helpful

### Formatting Rules
The system automatically formats explanations with:
- Sentence breaks for readability
- Backticks around exception names (e.g., `NullPointerException`)
- Backticks around Java API references (e.g., `java.lang.String`)
- Proper spacing and line breaks

### Example Explanations:
```
"Casting an int to a byte results in overflow. The value 258 modulo 256 is 2, so the byte value is 2. The output is 2."

"Two imports bring in classes named Date from different packages, making the reference to Date ambiguous. The code fails to compile because the compiler cannot determine which Date class to use."
```

## üéØ Question Types and Patterns

### Code Output Questions (Most Common)
- Present a code snippet
- Ask for the output or behavior
- Test edge cases and corner cases

**Template:**
```
What is the output of the following code?
[code snippet]
```

### Compilation Error Questions
- Show code with compilation issues
- Test understanding of Java syntax rules

**Template:**
```
What happens when compiling the following code?
[code snippet]
```

### Conceptual Questions
- Test understanding of Java concepts without code
- Focus on OOP principles, language features

**Template:**
```
Which of the following statements about [concept] is true?
```

### Multiple Concept Questions (Single-Choice Only)
- Test understanding of multiple related concepts in one question
- **System only supports single-choice selection** (A, B, C, D, or E)
- Combine multiple concepts into single answer options
- Use phrases like "Which option contains X valid statements?"

**Template:**
```
Which option contains two valid Java identifiers?
A) _name and 2name
B) $value and class  
C) name2 and _value
D) interface and 123name
```

**Important:** Don't use "Select all that apply" or "Select X options" - users can only choose one answer.

### Code Completion Questions
- Present incomplete code
- Ask what should fill the blanks

**Template:**
```
Choose the correct option to complete the following code:
[code with blanks]
```

## üîç Quality Assurance Rules

### Technical Accuracy
- All code must be syntactically correct (unless testing compilation errors)
- Answers must be technically accurate according to Java SE 8 specification
- Test with actual Java compiler when in doubt

### Difficulty Levels
- **Beginner**: Basic syntax, simple concepts
- **Intermediate**: Combined concepts, edge cases
- **Advanced**: Subtle language features, complex interactions

### Common Pitfalls to Test
- Operator precedence issues
- Variable scope problems
- Exception handling flow
- Object vs primitive behavior
- Inheritance and polymorphism subtleties
- Autoboxing/unboxing edge cases

### Java API Accuracy Checklist
- **Collections**: Verify method names and return types (e.g., `values()` returns `Collection<V>`, not `List<V>`)
- **Exception Names**: Use exact names (`NullPointerException`, not `NullException`)
- **Import Statements**: Verify correct package names (`java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap`)
- **Method Signatures**: Ensure parameter types and return types are correct
- **Java 8 Features**: Only include features available in Java SE 8 (no Java 9+ features like `Map.of()`)

### Code Compilation Verification
Before finalizing questions with code:
1. Copy code into a Java file
2. Compile with `javac` 
3. Run if applicable
4. Verify the actual output matches your expected answer
5. Test edge cases mentioned in options

## üìä CSV Formatting Rules

### Field Escaping
- Use double quotes around fields containing commas: `"Hello, World"`
- Escape internal quotes by doubling them: `"He said ""Hello"""`
- Avoid unnecessary quotes around simple text

### Line Breaks in Fields
- Use `\n` for intentional line breaks within fields
- The import system will handle proper formatting

### Special Characters
- Avoid special characters that might break CSV parsing
- Use standard ASCII characters when possible
- Test import functionality with your CSV before finalizing

### CSV Formatting Examples

**Correct escaping for commas:**
```csv
"Which method returns a Collection<V>?","values()","keySet()","entrySet()","get(), put()","clear()"
```

**Correct escaping for quotes in explanations:**
```csv
"Method put() replaces existing values. When we call put(""A"", 1) then put(""A"", 2), the second call overwrites the first."
```

**Correct line breaks in code questions:**
```csv
"What is the output?\nMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();\nmap.put(""key"", 42);\nSystem.out.println(map.get(""key""));"
```

## üöÄ Auto-Formatting Features

The system automatically applies these formatting improvements:

### Question Text
- Proper code block formatting with line breaks
- Spacing after question marks for multi-part questions
- Clean formatting of parenthetical instructions
- Whitespace cleanup while preserving intentional spacing

### Options
- Code formatting in options when detected
- Consistent spacing and cleanup

### Explanations
- Sentence breaks for readability
- Automatic backticks around exception names
- Automatic backticks around Java API references
- Proper spacing and paragraph breaks

## üìö Example Question Templates

### Template 1: Code Output
```csv
Java Basics,Variable Scope,"What is the output of the following code?
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 5;
        {
            int x = 10;
            System.out.println(x);
        }
        System.out.println(x);
    }
}",10 5,5 10,10 10,5 5,Compilation error,E,"You cannot declare a variable with the same name in a nested scope. This causes a compilation error because 'x' is already defined in the enclosing scope."
```

### Template 2: Conceptual
```csv
Working with Inheritance,Polymorphism,"Which statement about method overriding in Java is correct?",Overridden methods must have the same return type,Overridden methods can have a more restrictive access modifier,The @Override annotation is mandatory for overriding,Overridden methods can return a subtype of the original return type,Static methods can be overridden,D,"In Java, overridden methods can have covariant return types - they can return a subtype of the return type declared in the parent class method."
```

### Template 3: Multiple Selection
```csv
Java Basics,Variable Scope,"What happens when compiling the following code?

```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 5;
        {
            int x = 10;
            System.out.println(x);
        }
    }
}
```",Prints 10,Prints 5,Prints 10 then 5,Runtime exception,Compilation error,E,"You cannot declare a variable with the same name in a nested scope when the outer scope already has a variable with that name. This causes a compilation error because variable 'x' is already defined in the enclosing scope."
```
